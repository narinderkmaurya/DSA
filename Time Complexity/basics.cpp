it is not the time taken it is dependent on system



"rate at which the time taken increases wr.r.t size"



old windows machine             new macbook

    theta{rate of inc}          theta{rate of inc}

T.C

in terms of BIG- On Notation => O()

for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
{
    cout << "raj";
}
total number of steps======> Insane if done manually



'in terms of worst case scenario
'avoid constants
'avoid lower values

O(15)=== NOT APPROPRIATE

if i<n
=>   O(N x 3)

best average worst case

<25 =D
<45 =C
<65 = B
else = A



marsk=10 > 2 steps
m=70 > 4 STEPS


upper bound complexity -- BIG ON
lowe bond- OMEGA
Average -- Theta 

Space Complexity-----
memory space
big-O notation
Auxillary space + input space
take to solve  + to store the problemn

c=a+b
aux


inta[n];
b=a+b;
avoid lesser space but not in interview
take extra variables


1s= 10^8 operations
